# splitwise-lite
A lightweight web app for [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com), primarily focused on presenting a quick breakdown of who owes what and why.

## Purpose
This is not intended to be a replacement of the Splitwise [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/splitwise/id458023433) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Splitwise.SplitwiseMobile&hl=en_GB) apps, but rather an alternative way of presenting a custom 'transactions' view which would be useful in some cases. This also serves as a personally exercise in building an app with [React](https://reactjs.org/).

This project is a work-in-progress. The aim of the project is to view a simple breakdown of what is owed in a Splitwise group by transaction. This is not currently available in any of the Splitwise apps.

## Language
Primarily written in JavaScript and React.

## Other
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
